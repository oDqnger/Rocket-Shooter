# Rocket-Shooter

Rocket shooter is a game where you need to dodge or shoot incoming rocks flying at you. Your objective is to get through all 3 phases while being equipped with power-ups but by also being aware of the bombs that spawn out of no-where. You need to collect them before they explode. Overall, it's actually a pretty fun game.

# How to play?
I highly doubt that you would want to play it but as of right now, this is the only thing that is there to play. I might convert it to a WebGL game and host it on itch io. If that happens, I will update this README. But if you still somehow wanna play it, just download all the files and drag them over to your project (mainly the assets.) The library I'm using the post processing library for this.

# NOTE:
This is only my second game. I may update this game and add stuff like shops and overall make it a better game. There aren't any bugs in the game.
